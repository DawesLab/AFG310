AFG310
======

Files relevant to controlling a Tektronix AFG310 Arbitrary Function Generator. We generally communicate with the AFG310 via GPIB and most often using a USB-GPIB adapter. Hence the communication channel is a standard serial connection over which we send GPIB commands. This adds a small amount of complexity, but nothing too crazy.
